    <h4>Food and Health</h4>
    <p>About a year ago, my mom lost her fight with cancer. Despite her love for others and the selfless way she strove to make everyone else's lives
    better, she failed to take care of her own body and health. This was the first major wakeup call for me when it came to the food we eat. Once I switched
    to a vegan, plant-based diet, I saw the health benefits immediately. My energy levels soared, my bloating and constipation all but vanished, I began
    to shed the excess body fat, and my overall mood and happiness improved. I went from drinking 4-5 cups of coffee a day, down to 1 or 2. I went from
    having a "mid day lull" after lunch where I felt like I needed a nap, to having high energy throughout the day. So what exactly do I eat? Click the

    <h4>Food and Ethics</h4>
    <p>What finally pushed me into adopting a vegan lifestyle was when I realized that animals were suffering and dying and that I could not justify
    it on ethical or moral grounds. Once I acknowledged the terrible ordeal that an animal had to go through in order to end up on my plate, I
    realized that I could no longer justify my food choices. I never thought that I would become a vegan, and quite honestly I was scared to try
    because I thought that it would be very difficult. It turns out that it was one of the easiest life choice I have ever made! I wish that I had
    made this decision a long time ago, not only because of the health benefits I have personally enjoyed, but because I am helping to avoid needless
    suffering of animals. The agonizing death of an animal is a tragedy that is so easy to avoid by us simply choosing a vegan alternative at the grocery
    store or at a restaurant. Click the button below to read more about my thoughts on ethics and food.</p>
